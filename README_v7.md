# Loop Method System — README v7 (Legal Enforcement Edition)

## Overview

This repository documents and protects the symbolic system known as the Loop Method — a belief-based generative engine combining satire, cinematic grammar, recursive logic, and character infrastructure.

All symbolic elements, visual motifs, and rendering tools described within are governed by a legal architecture managed by Coda, Legal Architect, and authored solely by The Director.
